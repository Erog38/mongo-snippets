Driver replSet test runner.

Right now the tests are pretty simple (and a bit hacky), but it's a
start.

To run you need to write a program that does the equivalent of test.py
- take a host from stdin, use as a replset seed, print out all members
of the set, then just repeatedly do a find and print the result.

You need to specify the path to MongoDB executables. By default will
try ~/10gen/mongo, otherwise use --mongo_path. The rest of the cmd
line args will be used to specify your driver test program:

`python runner.py --mongo_path /opt/mongo/bin/ python test.py`
